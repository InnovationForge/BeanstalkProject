# To-Do List Application
Here's a guide on the functionality I will implement in this To-Do List Application using Thymeleaf and Spring Boot:

**User Registration and Authentication:**

*   [ ] Allow users to register and log in to their accounts.
*   [ ] Implement user authentication to ensure that only registered users can access their to-do lists.

**To-Do List Management:**

*   [x] Users should be able to create, update, and delete to-do items.
*   [x] Each to-do item can have a title, description, due date, and status (e.g., completed or pending).
*   [ ] Display the user's to-do list on the home page after they log in.

**To-Do Item Sorting and Filtering:**

*   [x] Provide options to sort and filter to-do items based on various criteria, such as due date or status.
*   [x] Allow users to mark items as completed, and have a separate section for completed items.

**Prioritization and Labels:**

*   [ ] Implement a way for users to prioritize to-do items (e.g., high, medium, low).
*   [ ] Allow users to assign labels or categories to their tasks for better organization.

**Search and Search Results:**

*   [x] Provide a search functionality that allows users to search for specific to-do items based on keywords or labels.
*   [x] Display search results in an organized manner.

**Due Date Notifications:**

*   [ ] Implement a notification system to remind users of approaching due dates for their tasks.

**User Profile:**

*   [ ] Allow users to update their profiles, including changing their password and profile picture.

**Sharing and Collaboration (Optional):**

*   [ ] If you want to add more advanced features, consider allowing users to share to-do lists with others and collaborate on tasks.

**Data Persistence:**

*   [ ] Store user data and to-do lists in a database to ensure data is retained between sessions.

**Security:**

*   [ ] Implement security best practices to protect user data and ensure that only authorized users can access and modify their to-do lists.

**Error Handling:**

*   [ ] Handle and display meaningful error messages to users when they encounter issues, such as validation errors or failed to-do item updates.

**User-Friendly Interface:**

*   [ ] Create a user-friendly and responsive interface using Thymeleaf templates with a clean design and easy navigation.

**Feedback and Notifications:**

*   [ ] Provide feedback to users when they add, update, or delete to-do items, and display notifications for important events.

**Testing:**

*   [ ] Write unit tests and integration test to ensure the application's functionality works as expected.

**Deployment:**

*   [ ] Deploy your application to some server or cloud hosting platform to make it accessible to users.
